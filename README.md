# Bens-Pizzeria

The main aim of this project is to create a database from scratch.
objective:

Ben, our client, is launching a new pizzeria in his town, focusing solely on take-out and delivery, similar to Domino's. He has provided us with a project brief outlining the need for a custom relational database. The goal is to design and construct a database that can efficiently capture and store crucial business information and data. By doing so, Ben will be equipped to closely track and evaluate the performance of his pizzeria.
